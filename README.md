This is a lightweight package for generating Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) samples
using various different methods.

## Tutorials and Documentation

For information on using the package,
[see the stable documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/QuasiMonteCarlo/stable/). Use the
[in-development documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/QuasiMonteCarlo/dev/) for the version of
the documentation, which contains the unreleased features.

## Example

```julia
using QuasiMonteCarlo, Distributions
lb = [0.1,-0.5]
ub = [1.0,20.0]
n = 5
d = 2

s = QuasiMonteCarlo.sample(n,lb,ub,GridSample([0.1,0.5]))
s = QuasiMonteCarlo.sample(n,lb,ub,UniformSample())
s = QuasiMonteCarlo.sample(n,lb,ub,SobolSample())
s = QuasiMonteCarlo.sample(n,lb,ub,LatinHypercubeSample())
s = QuasiMonteCarlo.sample(n,lb,ub,LatticeRuleSample())
s = QuasiMonteCarlo.sample(n,lb,ub,LowDiscrepancySample([10,3], false))
```

The output `s` is a matrix, so one can use things like `@uview` from
[UnsafeArrays.jl](https://github.com/oschulz/UnsafeArrays.jl) for a stack-allocated
view of the `i`th point:

```julia
using UnsafeArrays
@uview s[:,i]
```

## API

Everything has the same interface:

```julia
A = QuasiMonteCarlo.sample(n,lb,ub,sample_method)
```

where:

- `n` is the number of points to sample.
- `lb` is the lower bound for each variable. The length determines the dimensionality.
- `ub` is the upper bound.
- `sample_method` is the quasi-Monte Carlo sampling strategy.

Additionally, there is a helper function for generating design matrices:

```julia
k=2
As = QuasiMonteCarlo.generate_design_matrices(n,lb,ub,sample_method,k)
```

which returns `As` which is an array of `k` design matrices `A[i]` that are
all sampled from the same low-discrepancy sequence.

## Available Sampling Methods

* `GridSample(dx)` where the grid is given by `lb:dx[i]:ub` in the ith direction.
* `UniformSample` for uniformly distributed random numbers.
* `SobolSample` for the Sobol sequence.
* `LatinHypercubeSample` for a Latin Hypercube.
* `LatticeRuleSample` for a randomly-shifted rank-1 lattice rule.
* `LowDiscrepancySample(base)` where `base[i]` is the base in the ith direction.
* `GoldenSample` for a Golden Ratio sequence.
* `KroneckerSample(alpha, s0)` for a Kronecker sequence, where alpha is an length-d vector of irrational numbers (often sqrt(d)) and s0 is a length-d seed vector (often 0).
* `SectionSample(x0, sampler)` where `sampler` is any sampler above and `x0` is a vector of either `NaN` for a free dimension or some scalar for a constrained dimension.
* Additionally, any `Distribution` can be used, and it will be sampled from.

## Adding a new sampling method

Adding a new sampling method is a two-step process:

1. Add a new SamplingAlgorithm type.
2. Overload the sample function with the new type.

All sampling methods are expected to return a matrix with dimension `d` by `n`, where `d` is the dimension of the sample space and `n` is the number of samples.

**Example**

```julia
struct NewAmazingSamplingAlgorithm{OPTIONAL} <: SamplingAlgorithm end

function sample(n,lb,ub,::NewAmazingSamplingAlgorithm)
    if lb isa Number
        ...
        return x
    else
        ...
        return reduce(hcat, x)
    end
end
```
